            Hi! my name is Estéfano Chicco.
        </h1>
        
        <h3>
            I am a student of <b>Information Systems Engineering</b> of UTN, in the city of <i>Córdoba, Argentina</i>.
        </h3>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>
            I started in the world of programming as a simple hobby, for the simple fact that almost anything I could imagine could be represented in code, this led me to generate interest in learning more and more. I started in <b>2018</b> with C# because my idea was to create video games in my free time, but it didn't work out, it took me a long time to understand some things, so I put it aside.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The following year I started a course in my city, on PC maintenance and repair, in which I learned many things and enjoyed it. And, although not much, I did learn a bit about Batch.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In <b>2020</b> I had some problems with my computer, and it was solved by executing certain commands that I later captured in Batch to make my first program, although more than a program I would say a simple script that I tried to simplify the task of fixing the Windows system when it crashed, that's how FixIt! was born, my first project, which I still maintain today in my spare time.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Only in <b>2021</b> I decided to start with python, which seemed easier at first glance, and it was; I made a little game with python <i>"Governor of Blackjack"</i> based on the text line. Very simple but I learned many things with him. And in this same year I started a programming basics course that ends the following year.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In mid-<b>2021</b> I decided to start a web programming course with fullstack technologies <i>(html, css, javascript, typescript, angular, java, mysql, etc)</i> which I continue to do today.
